# python-api-challenge
I learned to convert JSON into a Python dictionary. I can also read and apply API documentation, use an API key, create applications with Python, load JSON into a DataFrame, handle errors, use the Geoapify and Census APIs, understand rate limits, create test cases, and dissect new API documentation.
